can expect real benchmark times ~2 seconds upto a minute if done badly

approach_1
process a whole dictionary file to find start, end words and the possible working space between
discard obvious misses ie length
iterate through looking for progress
- discard obvious failed steps

approach_2
leave it to genetrics

_3
as _1 but work backwards as well as forwards
- ie if one of these X words path is already known
- only if first checks are quicker or can help obvious discards

_4
