regex not-working https://regex101.com/r/fB1vY9/1

##

Fixing the string will be difficult, can create but how determine intention
- present list of options ?
- highlight the errant bit ? 
- present solution with explaination ? ie highlight change

Seperate routine for accepting changes to a failed run ?
- ie designed to cope/respond to small changes
- possibly tied to pre-presented solutions ie "I'll go with your suggest solution no3"
- need verbage to abonden or continue attempts

Memory of valid results 
+ leave to outside source

Show box expense ie how many used and wasted ones ie nothing inside or double cardboard
- need cost valution of box types and relative strength/properties

Some sort of safety rating
- to balance box expense and make sure weak goods have minimum
- use F instead of B, ie state type of content Fittings vs solid Bracket

error fixing

signals:
- types of containers already used / not used
- which containers are odd
- empty wrapings
- first/last container character
- number of itmes
- simularity to a standard solution ?
- 

reverse of error checking
- empty/too short
	if have a container char, pair it and put a B in
	else just give example/random 3 char
- first and last do not make pair
	check which one is missing a pair and add it to front/back
- item with no open
	check which one is missing a pair and add it to directly infront
	or add random surround on item
	(dodgy)
- close before open
	check which one is missing a pair and add it to directly infront
	(dodgy)
- close with no item
	remove empty wrapping ?
	add item ?
- close not the last opened
	close the last opened
	or check whether the last opened or close is mismatched
- illegal characters
	b -> B
	change characters near B on keyboard to B, although its not from a keyboard, near ascii codes ?
	or remove

ordering, prefer to add
- empty
- typos
- removals
	illegal, no items
- first/last
- close mismatch
- close with no open

? flip and close/open ie ]B[ to [B]

have to show what changed ? simple before/after ? 
? main method have to return labels, so need seperate wrapper to give msg's themselves
? work through errors from main method
? just fire all solutions then try valid? again

##

approach_1
loop left to right recording number opened and closed
- check if closed match last opened

_2
as _1 but also reverse check to quickly discard outside 
- ie its a single box it should match
- only useful for the outmost ?

_3
love the regex, believe in the regex
- simple pass/fail
- a bit britle
- faster ? surely

_4
- machine learning
