Fixing the string will be difficult, can create but how determine intention
- present list of options ?
- highlight the errant bit ? 
- present solution with explaination ? ie highlight change

Seperate routine for accepting changes to a failed run ?
- ie designed to cope/respond to small changes
- possibly tied to pre-presented solutions ie "I'll go with your suggest solution no3"
- need verbage to abonden or continue attempts

Memory of valid results ?
- ie this looks simular to this solution, want to use it instead ?

Show box expense ie how many used and wasted ones ie nothing inside or double cardboard
- need cost valution of box types and relative strength/properties

Some sort of safety rating
- to balance box expense and make sure weak goods have minimum
- use F instead of B, ie state type of content Fittings vs solid Bracket


approach_1
loop left to right recording number opened and closed
- check if closed match last opened

_2
as _1 but also reverse check to quickly discard outside 
- ie its a single box it should match
- only useful for the outmost ?
